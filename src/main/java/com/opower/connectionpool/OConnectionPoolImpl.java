/**
 * A singleton ConnectionPool that maintains a pool of OConnections. (Uses a LinkedList data structure).
 * It eagerly initializes the connections on instantiation so first time callers don't have to wait.
 * Uses a DataSource bean to determine the user settings. 
 * 
 * Maintains a map of connections to FutureTask. This is used to track the idle time of connections given from the pool.
 * Idle time is reset every time a connection method is invoked. Hence active connections are not considered abandoned
 * and are not forcibly recovered. Once idle time surpasses set limit, the connection
 * is released back into the pool by means of a scheduledTask.
